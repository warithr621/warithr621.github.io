								<p>Unfortunately since <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> does not allows scrolling over ten thousand messages
									due to subscription, I am at the moment unable to collect any exact data on placings that we had. However, I can definitely say
									that my first year participating in a Robotics club was a wonderful experience. Part of the programming team on
									<a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc/game-and-season" target="_blank">FTC</a> Team 12106 at Lowery Freshman Center, 
									we met twice a week in order to discuss the many aspects going into this competition: monetary situations, building the robot, programming its 
									various functions, and presenting our progress at competitions throughout the year. We also created a
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJWsxw81W9OxCXrQZO_80A/videos" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel that displays the progress from both of 
									our school's teams: <u>12106</u> and 15084. An example of one of these videos is embeded on your right.</p>

								<b>Codeforces:</b>
								<p>I started getting into competitve programming around New Year's Day 2021, and this is majorly because of UIL CS' Programming 
									Section as well as friends that I have met recently. <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/WalrusRamen21" target="_blank">
									Codeforces</a> is the first non-USACO website that I have used to practice and compete in coding competitions. I primarily code in
									Java nowadays due to UIL's requirement of the language, but I am also familiar with C++, Python, and Golang. Below is my 
									competition history on Codeforces, and how well I've done.</p>

								<b>AtCoder:</b>
								<p><a href="https://atcoder.jp/users/WalrusRamen21" target="_blank">AtCoder</a> is the other website I use to practice competitively program.
									Unfortunately, these contests are hosted on Japan time and thus start around 7 AM Central Time (6 AM with no Daylight Saving Time), so I've never
									actually participated in a contest. However, I practice problems from contests in order to improve my solving ability.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>GitHub:</b>
								<p>Obviously, <a href="https://github.com/warithr621" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is not a source for active programming contests. However, I've started to upload any submissions 
									I have made on my <a href="https://github.com/warithr621/Comp-Programming" target="_blank">Comp-Programming repository</a>, which includes submissions from CodeForces, 
									AtCoder, USACO, and any other programming contests I have participated in.</p>
