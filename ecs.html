								<b>2020-2021 FTC Season (September 2020 - May 2021):</b>
								<p>Unfortunately since <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> does not allows scrolling over ten thousand messages
									due to subscription, I am at the moment unable to collect any exact data on placings that we had. However, I can definitely say
									that my first year participating in a Robotics club was a wonderful experience. Part of the programming team on
									<a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc/game-and-season" target="_blank">FTC</a> Team 12106 at Lowery Freshman Center, 
									we met twice a week in order to discuss the many aspects going into this competition: monetary situations, building the robot, programming its 
									various functions, and presenting our progress at competitions throughout the year. We also created a
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJWsxw81W9OxCXrQZO_80A/videos" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel that displays the progress from both of 
									our school's teams: <u>12106</u> and 15084. An example of one of these videos is embeded on your right.</p>

								<b>2021-2022 BEST Season (September 2021 - December 2021):</b>
								<p>This was my first year as part of the AHS Robotics team, and I really enjoyed meeting so many new people both in my grade and in the 
									Classes of 2022 and 2023. Alongside several others, I worked on programming our robot for the BEST competition. From the local <b>Co</b>llin 
									<b>Co</b>unty BEST competition we advanced to the state competition, where we placed state runner-ups in the UIL 5A-6A Conference.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>2022-2023 BEST Season (September 2022 - December 2022):</b>
								<p>My 2nd year in Allen HS' Robotics team, I continued to help out in the programming department for BEST competitions. Although we didn't end up performing
									as well as last year, we still advanced from the CoCo BEST competition to make state! I also helped a bit with Eaglets: a student-based section of our 
									Robotics team where we would develop robotics kits to spark interest in elementary school students.</p>

								<b>2021 UIL Season:</b>
								<p>This was my first year competing in UIL at the high school level. Although just a freshman, I was able to make my way 
									into six different UIL teams. I managed to advance in all six of these--either individually or through team--to the 
									regional competition. Out of these six I only made state in two of these competitions, but I was also part of the UIL 
									Spelling Team that won 1st at the state competition :D </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>2022 UIL Season:</b>
								<p>With Year 2 underway, and my first one in-person due to COVID the past year, I was really excited to see what was to come. 
									For districts I once again made six different teams, although this year I made it in for science rather than spelling. I managed to 
									qualify for regionals in all six competitions I did, including placing top 3 individually at five of these competitions at districts. 
									I then managed to qualify in five competitions to state, with the exception of Computer Applications (though placing in this at the regional level 
									for the second consecutive year. This also included being a part of the <b>first</b> Allen Computer Science team to make UIL State, and being the 
									first calculator state qualifier from Allen in five years. Although I wasn't able to place individually in any of my competitions, I was a part of the 
									3rd place state team in three categories: Number Sense, Science, and General Math.</p>

								<b>USACO:</b>
								<p><a href="http://usaco.org/" target="_blank">USACO</a> is the primary programming contest in the United States, hosting four competitions annually and allowing 
								the highest-ranked students to participate in a summer camp leading to <a href="https://ioinformatics.org/" target="_blank">IOI, the International Olympiad in 
									Informatics</a>.</p>
								<p>I started competing in USACO at the start of my freshman year, score a 513 on the <a href="http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=jan21results" target="_blank">2021 January Contest</a>. 
									After about a year's worth of preparation, I scored high enough on the <a href="http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=dec21results" target="_blank">December Contest</a> 
									later that year in order to promote to the Silver division where I currently am.</p>

								<b>Codeforces:</b>
								<p>I started getting into competitve programming around New Year's Day 2021, and this is majorly because of UIL CS' Programming 
									Section as well as friends that I have met recently. <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/WalrusRamen21" target="_blank">
									Codeforces</a> is the first non-USACO website that I have used to practice and compete in coding competitions. On this website I primarily submit 
								solutions in C++ (though I often switch to Java, especially in prep for UIL), and I'm currently rated as a specialist as of 
									<a href="https://codeforces.com/submissions/WalrusRamen21/contest/1714">August 2 2022</a>.</p>

								<b>GitHub:</b>
								<p>Obviously, <a href="https://github.com/warithr621" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is not a source for active programming contests. However, I've started to upload any submissions 
									I have made on my <a href="https://github.com/warithr621/Comp-Programming" target="_blank">Comp-Programming repository</a>, which includes submissions from CodeForces, 
									USACO, my prorgess on USACO Guide, and any other contests I've participated in involving programming. My GitHub also links to a couple of other cool resources, 
									such as a Semester Exam calculator I developed and writeups from a CTF (Cybersecurity Capture the Flag) competition I participated in with some friends.</p>
