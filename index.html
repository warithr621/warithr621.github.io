						<p>Hi, I'm Warith! I recently graduated from Allen High School in Texas, and am now at UT Austin studying Computer Science. I created this website to help share a bit more about me, and additionally practice my own web design skills.</p>
						<p>While in high school, some of the main activities I did included competing in the University Interscholastic League (winning two individual golds in my senior year), teaching students through volunteering and work, and exploring new passions and hobbies. I regularly try to keep practicing my algorithmic knowledge through either CSES or Leetcode, and I recently began to try working out and hopefully continue this throughout university.</p>
						<p>Outside of school, I love to keep up with the latest soccer and cricket news (and am trying to get into basketball), and often use my free time chatting with my friends or playing on <a href="https://ch.tetr.io/u/walrusramen21" target="_blank">TETR.IO</a>. I also love listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Cci3Weu5ldkeqCpkexjos?si=1760cd15a8014c99" target="_blank">K-pop</a> whether I'm studying for a test or surfing through social media, getting into the genre through TWICE back in 2021 and since embracing the music (although luck has not favored me in attending a concert yet).</p>
						<p>Anyways, feel free to explore the website and explore all there is to know about me! If you have any questions (or website suggestions as I'm still improving in HTML/CSS), reach out through any of the means in the <a href="contact.html">Contact tab</a> above. Thanks!</p>
