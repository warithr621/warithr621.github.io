						<p>Good question... Hey everyone, I'm Warith! I'm a rising senior at Allen High School in Allen, Texas. I thought it was a good idea to make a website all about whatever I do.</p>
						<p>I've enjoyed doing math for a long part of my life, and it's always great to learn new concepts and help others expand their knowledge! I've also recently picked up
							competitive programming as an additional hobby on my day-to-day basis, and enjoy keeping up with the latest soccer & cricket news and playing video games in my free time
							(primarily FIFA).</p>
						<p>Feel free to look around this website for more information about me, what I've done in the past and do now, and how to contact me about anything. I'd also appreciate
							any suggestions for improvements to this site, since HTML and CSS are definitely not my main languages :(</p>
