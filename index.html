						<p>That's a really good question. As you can tell, my name is indeed Warith Rahman. I'm a rising junior attending Allen High School in Texas.
							I decided to create this website as a method of organizing all I have done in my life thus far, as well as including whatever happens in the near future.</p>
						<p>I've enjoyed doing math for a long part of my life, and it's always great to learn new concepts and help others expand their knowledge! I've also recently picked up
							competitive programming as an additional hobby on my day-to-day basis, and enjoy keeping up with the latest soccer news and playing video games in my free time.</p>
						<p>Feel free to look around this website for more information about me, what I've done in the past and do now, and how to contact me about anything. I'd also appreciate
							any suggestions for improvements to this site, since HTML and CSS are definitely not my main languages :(</p>
