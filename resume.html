				<p>I worked under Dr. Chris Davis at the University of Texas at Dallas in the Natural Language Processing Summer Research Workshop. I developed scripts using Python's NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) module to conduct linguistic analysis, such as word frequency and part of speech analysis. These scripts can be found <a href="https://github.com/warithr621/UTD-NLP" target="_blank">here</a> on GitHub.</p>

				</div>
				<p>As a mentor for the Allen Aspire program, I designed lesson plans to aid Allen ISD middle schoolers in their competitive journey through TMSCA (Texas Math and Science Coaches' Association) contests. I also co-wrote test papers, including being the chief writer for the Number Sense test, for three years for an annual Allen-exclusive mock contest for students. Since the outreach program officially launched in the 2021 - 2022 school year, we have been able to boost Allen ISD's state qualifier count to consistently 60+ students every year between Ereckson and Curtis Middle School, including 24 students placing at the state level across these three years.</p>
