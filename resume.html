				<h2>Experience</h2>

				<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between; align-items:center;">
					<h3>Undergrad Researcher (UT Austin)</h3>
					<div style="float:right;"><h3>Jan 2024 - Present</h3></div>
				</div>
				<p>As a part of the Freshman Research Initiative, I will partake in the EvoDevOmics stream under Dr. Rebecca Young and Dr. Joseph Dubie. In this program, I will be directly contributing to research involving the relation between gene expression and the development of tadpoles into adult frogs, including data visualization and ML-induced analysis.</p>

				<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between; align-items:center;">
					<h3>Software Developer (Longhorn Developers)</h3>
					<div style="float:right;"><h3>Sep 2024 - Present</h3></div>
				</div>
				<p>As a part of Longhorn Developers, I have the opportunity to directly contribute to <a href="">UT Registration Plus</a>. This is an extension that eases the registration process for students at the University of Texas at Austin. With over 60,000 downloads, this extension provides information such as a user-friendly calendar and grade distributions to aid students in registering for future classes. My PRs on this have helped me better understand the uses of sprints in the development cycle, as well as using TypeScript in development.</p>


				<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between; align-items:center;">
					<h3>Chief Physics Test Writer (TMSCA | Remote Contract)</h3>
					<div style="float:right;"><h3>Aug 2024 - Present</h3></div>
				</div>
				<p>Under contract for the 2024 - 2025 school year, I am delegated as the primary writer for the physics section of science tests. My primary responsibility is to create physics questions for each of 16 tests administered by TMSCA, including those tested at the annual high school state meet. I also work with the UIL Physics Director (Dr. David Bixler of Angelo State University) and the UIL Liaison (Cliff McCurdy) to ensure the problems are up to standard under UIL guidelines and are without error.</p>


				<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between; align-items:center;">
					<h3>Artificial Intelligence Tester (Outlier | Freelance)</h3>
					<div style="float:right;"><h3>Jul 2024 - Present</h3></div>
				</div>
				<p>My job is to optimize the role of artificial intelligence chatbots by critiquing responses according to several dimensions, such as truthfulness and satisfaction. As of August 2024 I am working on the "Bee SFT Math Rewrites" project, where I provide feedback on and rewrite AI responses to mathematical queries in order to improve accuracy and LaTeX formatting.</p>


				<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between; align-items:center;">
					<h3>Math Instructor (Mathnasium)</h3>
					<div style="float:right;"><h3>Apr 2024 - Aug 2024</h3></div>
				</div>
				<p>I consistently managed a group of up to 4 students ranging from kindergarten to high school, and assisted in grading papers, reviewing questions to cover new strategies or mistakes, and writing reflections on daily sessions. I also helped maintain the cleanliness of the learning center.</p>


				<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between; align-items:center;">
					<h3>Summer Research Intern (UT Dallas | Hyrbid)</h3>
					<div style="float:right;"><h3>Jun 2023 - Jul 2023</h3></div>
				</div>
				<p>I worked under Dr. Chris Davis at the University of Texas at Dallas in the Natural Language Processing Summer Research Workshop. I developed scripts using Python's NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) module to conduct linguistic analysis, such as word frequency and part of speech analysis. These scripts can be found <a href="https://github.com/warithr621/UTD-NLP" target="_blank">here</a> on GitHub.</p>


				<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between; align-items:center;">
					<h3>Retail Associate (T.J. Maxx & Homegoods)</h3>
					<div style="float:right;"><h3>Jul 2022 - Aug 2022</h3></div>
				</div>
				<p>I worked as a cashier throughout the summer, and additionally closed the store on weeknights.</p>


				<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between; align-items:center;">
					<h3>Mentor and Test Writer (Allen Aspire)</h3>
					<div style="float:right;"><h3>Apr 2021 - May 2024</h3></div>
				</div>
				<p>As a mentor for the Allen Aspire program, I designed lesson plans to aid Allen ISD middle schoolers in their competitive journey through TMSCA (Texas Math and Science Coaches' Association) contests. I also co-wrote test papers, including being the chief writer for the Number Sense test, for three years for an annual Allen-exclusive mock contest for students. Since the outreach program officially launched in the 2021 - 2022 school year, we have been able to boost Allen ISD's state qualifier count to consistently 60+ students every year between Ereckson and Curtis Middle School, including 24 students placing at the state level across these three years.</p>
