								<b>2020-2021 FTC Season (12 September 2020 - 22 May 2021):</b>
								<p>Unfortunately since <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> does not allows scrolling over ten thousand messages
									due to subscription, I am at the moment unable to collect any exact data on placings that we had. However, I can definitely say
									that my first year participating in a Robotics club was a wonderful experience. Part of the programming team on
									<a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc/game-and-season" target="_blank">FTC</a> Team 12106 at Lowery Freshman Center, 
									we met twice a week in order to discuss the many aspects going into this competition: monetary situations, building the robot, programming its 
									various functions, and presenting our progress at competitions throughout the year. We also created a
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJWsxw81W9OxCXrQZO_80A/videos" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel that displays the progress from both of 
									our school's teams: <u>12106</u> and 15084. An example of one of these videos is embeded on your right.</p>

								<b>2021-2022 BEST Season (September 2021 - December 2022):</b>
								<p>This was my first year as part of the AHS Robotics team, and I really enjoyed meeting so many new people both in my grade and in the 
								Classes of 2022 and 2023. Alongside several others, I worked on programming our robot for the BEST competition. From the local <b>Co</b>llin 
									<b>Co</b>unty BEST competition we advanced to the state competition, where we placed 2nd out of all competing teams.</p>

								<b>2021 UIL Season:</b>
								<p>This was my first year competing in UIL at the high school level. Although just a freshman, I was able to make my way 
									into six different UIL teams. I managed to advance in all six of these--either individually or through team--to the 
									regional competition. Out of these six I only made state in two of these competitions, but I was also part of the UIL 
									Spelling Team that won 1st at the state competition :D </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>2022 UIL Season:</b>
								<p>With Year 2 underway, and my first one in-person due to COVID the past year, I was really excited to see what was to come. 
								For districts I once again made six different teams, although this year I made it in for science rather than spelling. I managed to 
								qualify for regionals in all six competitions I did, including placing top 3 individually at five of these competitions at districts. 
								I then managed to qualify in five competitions to state, with the exception of Computer Applications. This also included being a part of 
									the <b>first</b> Allen Computer Science team to make UIL State, and being the first calculator state qualifier from Allen in five years. 
								Although I wasn't able to place individually in any of my competitions, I was a part of the 3rd place state team in three categories: 
								Number Sense, Science, and General Math.</p>

								<b>USACO:</b>
								<p><a href="http://usaco.org/" target="_blank">USACO</a> is the primary programming contest in the United States, hosting four competitions annually and allowing 
								the highest-ranked students to participate in a summer camp leading to <a href="https://ioinformatics.org/" target="_blank">IOI, the International Olympiad in 
									Informatics</a>.</p>
								<p>I started competing in USACO at the start of my freshman year, score a 513 on the <a href="http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=jan21results" target="_blank">2021 January Contest</a>. 
									After about a year's worth of preparation, I scored high enough on the <a href="http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=dec21results" target="_blank">December Contest</a> 
									later that year in order to promote to the Silver division where I currently am.</p>

								<b>Codeforces:</b>
								<p>I started getting into competitve programming around New Year's Day 2021, and this is majorly because of UIL CS' Programming 
									Section as well as friends that I have met recently. <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/WalrusRamen21" target="_blank">
									Codeforces</a> is the first non-USACO website that I have used to practice and compete in coding competitions. On this website I primarily submit 
								solutions in C++ (though I often switch to Java, especially in prep for UIL), and I'm currently rated as a pupil as of 
									<a href="https://codeforces.com/submissions/WalrusRamen21/contest/1686">May 25 2022</a>.</p>

								<b>GitHub:</b>
								<p>Obviously, <a href="https://github.com/warithr621" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is not a source for active programming contests. However, I've started to upload any submissions 
									I have made on my <a href="https://github.com/warithr621/Comp-Programming" target="_blank">Comp-Programming repository</a>, which includes submissions from CodeForces, 
									AtCoder, USACO, and any other programming contests I have participated in.</p>
